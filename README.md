ðŸ”¥ Project Description: Autonomous Incentive Platform for Solana
We are building a decentralized platform powered by AI agents that autonomously interact with humans and protocols on Solana â€” paying users in crypto tokens for completing specific on-chain or off-chain actions. Using AI automation, blockchain transparency, and programmable incentives, the platform bridges web3 coordination with AI execution.

The system runs on custom AI agents that monitor, respond to, and reward user behavior in real-time. All rewards are distributed via a Solana-based token, ensuring fast, low-cost transactions and composability with the Solana ecosystem.

ðŸ§  Our First Two Agents
1. X Engagement AI Agent (x402-powered Raiding Bot)
An AI agent that connects to X (formerly Twitter) and uses the x402 protocol to pay users for likes, retweets, and comments on a specific tweet. Admins define which tweets are eligible and what actions are rewarded. The agent verifies user engagement through public APIs and distributes rewards when criteria are met. Perfect for viral campaigns, meme coins, or community growth.

Example use case: Launching a token and paying users who help create buzz around it on X.

2. Pump.fun Sniper AI Agent
This agent monitors Pump.fun, a popular Solana token launchpad. It watches for new tokens deployed by pre-defined developer wallets (set by the admin). When it detects a new launch, it automatically uses a wallet (funded with SOL) to buy into the token early, acting as a smart AI sniper.

Example use case: Automatically backing reputable builder launches in real-time, without human delay.

ðŸ§© Core Platform Features
AI Agents as Services: Each agent is modular, customizable, and runs continuously or on triggers.
Crypto Wallet Authentication: Users connect their Solana wallets to interact or earn.
Tokenized Incentives: Rewards are paid in a platform-specific token, distributed based on agent logic.
Developer Dashboard: Manage agents, configure behaviors, view logs, fund wallets.
Automation Meets Community Growth: Designed for Solana-native projects, meme coins, DeFi apps, and DAOs.
